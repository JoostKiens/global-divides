          The disparity is stark and thought-provoking. The burden of climate
          change, a shadow cast largely by the North, falls unevenly on the
          South.

          Is it fair for the South to bear the costs of protection alone? Should
          the North, as the principal architects of pollution, step up to share
          this critical responsibility?
